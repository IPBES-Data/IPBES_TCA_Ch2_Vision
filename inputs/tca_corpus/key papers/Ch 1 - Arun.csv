While numerous national and international responses have been put in place to stem this loss, none have succeeded in significantly reducing its rate. Reasons for these failures are not uniform, but some key identified features include inadequate funding and logistical support, structural weaknesses in targeted actions, and the socio-political systems that interfere with needed transformative changes. This article provides a brief historical background to global-level biodiversity conservation efforts and suggests pathways needed to move forward if the proposed vision of “Living in Harmony with Nature” by 2050 is to be realized. Framing socio-economic and cultural development within the dual crises of biodiversity loss and climate change, and not the other way around, represents the most likely path to success. This effort will require strong actions from communities and institutions, from local to global, to end the disconnect between global targets, national commitments, and local actions; reformed mechanisms for funding and other support; and radically improved strategies to galvanize both political will and public support through improved communication.","2021-08-30","2023-10-06 06:24:25","2023-10-06 06:24:25","2023-10-06 06:24:25","31-39","","","","","","Reversing global biodiversity declines","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/rainerkrug/Zotero TfC Ch 2/storage/K7PCTY34/Bjorkland and Bjorkland - 2021 - Reversing global biodiversity declinesMainstreami.pdf","","","","Omura, Paige; Knappe, Grant","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
