Transformative governance principles have been proposed to overcome these limitations. Using a transformative governance lens, we use the case of the Norwegian ‘‘Climate Cure 2030’’ for the Land Use, LandUse Change and Forestry (LULUCF) sector to, ﬁrst, illustrate the mechanisms that have led to the choice of climate mitigation measures; second, to analyze the potential consequences of these measures on biodiversity and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions; and, third, to evaluate alternative measures with potential positive outcomes for biodiversity and GHG emissions/removals.

This would be in line with the idea of a green transformation as a necessary contribution to bring human social-ecological action back within planetary boundaries. We start from a general conceptualization of a green transformation and its potential drivers, then analyze the basis and prospects for such developments by providing a review of the country’s forest politics, including a mapping of relevant stakeholders that have been influential in designing and implementing the national PES and REDD+ approaches. Based on original empirical analysis that was conducted throughout 2017, we further analyze recent institutional developments of setting up a cross-sectoral policy for agriculture and environment as part of a broader landscape management approach, including the opportunities and challenges that might arise with a view to realizing this idea on the ground.","2019","2023-09-13 14:32:25","2023-09-13 14:32:25","2023-09-13 14:32:25","art24","","1","24","","E&S","Beyond PES and REDD+","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/rainerkrug/Zotero TfC Ch 2/storage/QRLJTIEZ/Wallbott et al. - 2019 - Beyond PES and REDD+ Costa Rica on the way to cli.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The framework emphasizes that regenerative systems maintain positive reinforcing cycles of wellbeing within and beyond themselves, especially between humans and wider nature, such that ‘‘life begets life.’’ We identify ﬁve key qualities needed in systems to encourage such dynamics: an ecological worldview embodied in human action; mutualism; high diversity; agency for humans and non-humans to act regeneratively; and continuous reﬂexivity.

"XN93W5NJ","journalArticle","","Weichselgartner, Juergen; Kelman, Ilan","Challenges and opportunities for building urban resilience","","","","","","In science, the resilience concept has increasingly been embraced as a framework for disasterrelated work. As a result, policy supports ‘resilient communities’ programs. The current transition from a ‘descriptive’ scientific concept explaining the state of a system to a ‘normative’ agenda applied by local authorities faces various challenges. To contribute to the A|Z journal’s special issue on Cities at Risk, this paper argues that it is crucial to address and explain these challenges in order to effectively increase resilience. It examines some theoretical foundations and underlying assumptions of the resilience concept and highlights some challenges associated with practical application in urban locations. Most importantly, the chronic needs and root causes of vulnerability will remain unsolved and will continue to generate vulnerable groups as long as efforts to increase resilience ignore the preconditions and root causes of (what is effectively social and political) vulnerability. Building resilience in cities provides opportunities to address under-studied elements, to gain understanding about the historical and socio-political processes that create and maintain social vulnerabilities, and to develop designs capable of identifying options for intervention and leverage points that can move communities toward less vulnerable development pathways.","","2023-09-13 14:32:29","2023-09-25 13:35:03","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","/Users/rainerkrug/Zotero TfC Ch 2/storage/FPQ87PNN/Weichselgartner and Kelman - Challenges and opportunities for building urban re.pdf","","","⛔ No DOI found","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We describe a wellbeing economy as an alternative for guiding policy development. In 2018, a network of Wellbeing Economy Governments (WEGo), (supported by, but distinct from, the larger Wellbeing Economy Alliance—WEAll) promoting new forms of governance that diverge from the ones on which the G7 and G20 are based, has been launched and is now a living project. Members of WEGo aim at advancing the three key principles of a wellbeing economy: Live within planetary ecological boundaries, ensure equitable distribution of wealth and opportunity, and efficiently allocate resources (including environmental and social public goods), bringing wellbeing to the heart of policymaking, and in particular economic policymaking. This network has potential to fundamentally re-shape current global leadership still anchored to old economic paradigms that give primacy to economic growth over environmental and social wealth and wellbeing.","2019-08-13","2023-09-13 14:32:33","2023-09-13 14:32:33","2023-09-13 14:32:33","4374","","16","11","","Sustainability","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/rainerkrug/Zotero TfC Ch 2/storage/F4EWXRU7/Coscieme et al. - 2019 - Overcoming the Myths of Mainstream Economics to En.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Critics have objected to this initiative as harboring hardship for people near protected areas and for failing to confront the growth economy as the main engine of global ecological destruction. In response to the ﬁrst criticism, we afﬁrm that conservation policies must be designed and implemented in collaboration with Indigenous and local communities. In response to the second criticism, we argue that protecting half the Earth needs to be complemented by downscaling and reforming economic life, humanely and gradually reducing the global population, and changing food production and consumption. By protecting nature generously, and simultaneously contracting and transforming the human enterprise, we can create the conditions for achieving justice and well-being for both people and other species.

New findings give urgency to this union: Less than half of the terrestrial realm is intact, yet conserving all native ecosystems—coupled with energy transition measures—will be required to remain below a 1.5°C rise in average global temperature. The GDN targets 30% of Earth to be formally protected and an additional 20% designated as climate stabilization areas, by 2030, to stay below 1.5°C.

It is a crisis that offers opportunities for dealing with three interrelated crises: the ecological crisis (climate change, loss of biodiversity, resource depletion, pollution and ecosystem destruction), the confidence crisis (people losing trust in government, politics, companies, regular news channels, science, each other and the future), and the inequality crisis (the widening of the gap between rich and poor). Our argument is that sustainability transitions will not succeed without a different economy and another social contract with rights and duties of care for the environment and the well-being of others, including future generations. A different social contract is not only desirable from the point of view of sustainability and fairness, and justice and equality, but it is also necessary to restore citizens’ trust in politics, government, companies and each other. In the paper we discuss mechanisms towards a Natural Social Contract: systemic leverage points for system transformations and possibilities for co-evolutionary governance by actor coalitions interested in transformative change.

When in 1988 the Brundtland report called for tripling the world’s protected area estate (which was then at 3 to 4 per cent of the land area) there was a strong belief that sustainable development would ensure the proper care for nature on the rest of the unprotected earth. This has proven wrong. We therefore must materially shift our protected areas target to protect at least half of the world, land and water, in an interconnected way to conform with what conservation biologists have learned about the needs of nature. Instead we have set goals that are politically determined, with arbitrary percentages that rest on an unarticulated hope that such non-scientific goals are a good first step towards some undefined better future outcome.

It is time for conservationists to reset the debate based on scientific findings and assert nature’s needs fearlessly.","2013-11-05","2023-09-13 14:33:02","2023-09-13 14:33:02","2023-09-13 14:33:02","13-22","","2","19","","PARKS","Nature needs half","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/rainerkrug/Zotero TfC Ch 2/storage/6I2LA74R/Locke - 2013 - Nature needs half a necessary and hopeful new age.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Economic growth has been identified as one of the key drivers of these losses, however, the impact pathway may depend on how society organizes economic activity and distributes its benefits. Here we use a global country-level dataset to show how the strength of national institutions and economic inequality in society can mediate the loss of biodiversity worldwide. We find that the interplay of institutions and inequality fully mediates the impact of economic growth on plant biodiversity, but only partially mediates the impact on animal biodiversity. Furthermore, in sustaining biodiversity, the effectiveness of institutions depends on inequality in society, such that biodiversity loss is ameliorated when institutions are strong and inequality low, but in regions with high inequality, institutions tend to lose their efficacy. The analysis also uncovers nonlinearities in inequality, institutions, and biodiversity interactions, which are important to investigate further and consider for policy purposes.","2020","2023-09-13 14:33:05","2023-09-13 14:33:05","2023-09-13 14:33:05","art39","","4","25","","E&S","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/rainerkrug/Zotero TfC Ch 2/storage/QTAY3Z4K/Mirza et al. - 2020 - Institutions and inequality interplay shapes the i.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Nonetheless, a review of international biodiversity and sustainability policies shows that the majority advocate economic growth. Since improvements in resource use efficiency have so far not allowed for absolute global reductions in resource use and pollution, we question the support for economic growth in these policies, where inadequate attention is paid to the question of how growth can be decoupled from biodiversity loss. Drawing on the literature about alternatives to economic growth, we explore this contradiction and suggest ways forward to halt global biodiversity decline. These include policy proposals to move beyond the growth paradigm while enhancing overall prosperity, which can be implemented by combining top-down and bottom-up governance across scales. Finally, we call the attention of researchers and policy makers to two immediate steps: acknowledge the conflict between economic growth and biodiversity conservation in future policies; and explore socioeconomic trajectories beyond economic growth in the next generation of biodiversity scenarios.","2020-07","2023-09-13 14:33:11","2023-09-13 14:33:11","2023-09-13 14:33:11","e12713","","4","13","","CONSERVATION LETTERS","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/rainerkrug/Zotero TfC Ch 2/storage/2VBTD69E/Otero et al. - 2020 - Biodiversity policy beyond economic growth.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, we use modelling and literature assessment to quantify safe and just Earth system boundaries (ESBs) for climate, the biosphere, water and nutrient cycles, and aerosols at global and subglobal scales. We propose ESBs for maintaining the resilience and stability of the Earth system (safe ESBs) and minimizing exposure to significant harm to humans from Earth system change (a necessary but not sufficient condition for justice)               4               . The stricter of the safe or just boundaries sets the integrated safe and just ESB. Our findings show that justice considerations constrain the integrated ESBs more than safety considerations for climate and atmospheric aerosol loading. Seven of eight globally quantified safe and just ESBs and at least two regional safe and just ESBs in over half of global land area are already exceeded. We propose that our assessment provides a quantitative foundation for safeguarding the global commons for all people now and into the future.","2023-07-06","2023-09-13 14:33:16","2023-09-13 14:33:16","2023-09-13 14:33:16","102-111","","7968","619","","Nature","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/rainerkrug/Zotero TfC Ch 2/storage/LF97I3IT/Rockström et al. - 2023 - Safe and just Earth system boundaries.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Meaningful participation is understood as a collaborative process based on the recognition of IPLCs and their contribution to biodiversity management. The CBD is currently the main instrument for global biodiversity governance, enjoying almost-universal application - with the notable exception of the USA. It arguably provides the most advanced framework for the participation of IPLCs among the multilateral environmental agree­ ments. Following a discussion of challenges regarding concepts and terminology, we provide brief overviews of IPLCs' contributions to the conservation and sus­ tainable use of biodiversity and the evolution of the CBD framework to partially recognize these. We then focus on two case studies: the negotiation and adoption of the Nagoya Protocol on access to genetic resources and fair and equitable benefit-sharing; and the negotiation of the 2022 Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework. On the basis of a literature review, content analysis of UN documents, and participant observation at CBD meetings, we combine legal and sociological analysis to find that early gains towards building collaborative spaces for IPLCs in CBD processes in the adoption of the Nagoya Protocol seemed to be receding in the negotiation of the Global Biodiversity Framework, until adoption of the final text which surprisingly integrated a strong rights-based approach, for the first time in the history of the CBD.","2023-04","2023-09-13 14:33:20","2023-09-13 14:33:21","2023-09-13 14:33:20","109933","","","280","","Biological Conservation","Transforming biodiversity governance?","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/rainerkrug/Zotero TfC Ch 2/storage/EGHQK2VG/Parks and Tsioumani - 2023 - Transforming biodiversity governance Indigenous p.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
