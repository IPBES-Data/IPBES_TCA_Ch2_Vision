  abstract = {The rapid and unprecedented global loss of biodiversity threatens the wide-ranging goods and services that nature provides, endangers human institutions, and portends future scenarios of human-nature relationships that differ significantly from what humans have experienced historically. While numerous national and international responses have been put in place to stem this loss, none have succeeded in significantly reducing its rate. Reasons for these failures are not uniform, but some key identified features include inadequate funding and logistical support, structural weaknesses in targeted actions, and the socio-political systems that interfere with needed transformative changes. This article provides a brief historical background to global-level biodiversity conservation efforts and suggests pathways needed to move forward if the proposed vision of ``Living in Harmony with Nature'' by 2050 is to be realized. Framing socio-economic and cultural development within the dual crises of biodiversity loss and climate change, and not the other way around, represents the most likely path to success. This effort will require strong actions from communities and institutions, from local to global, to end the disconnect between global targets, national commitments, and local actions; reformed mechanisms for funding and other support; and radically improved strategies to galvanize both political will and public support through improved communication.},
